# 🏟️ SportNest - Sports Facility Booking Management System

## 📌 Project Name
SportNest

---

## 🎯 Purpose
SportNest is a full-stack sports facility booking platform built with the MERN stack.  
It allows users to explore sports facilities such as football turfs, badminton courts, swimming pools, and tennis courts, and book them for specific time slots.

Facility owners can add, update, and manage their facilities, while users can book and manage their reservations easily.

This project simulates a real-world sports reservation system like Playo or BookMyTurf.
